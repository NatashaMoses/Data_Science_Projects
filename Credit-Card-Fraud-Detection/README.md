# Credit Card Fraud Detection
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models. It includes data exploration, preprocessing, and training multiple classification models. Here's a detailed walkthrough of the workflow in the notebook.

## 1. Introduction
This project addresses the problem of credit card fraud detection using a variety of machine learning algorithms. The steps include:

Loading and exploring the dataset
Preprocessing the data
Training different models
Tuning hyperparameters
Evaluating model performance
The goal is to identify fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives accurately.

## 2. Setup and Imports
In the first section of the notebook, I imported essential libraries:

Pandas for data manipulation
Numpy for numerical operations
Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations
Scikit-learn and XGBoost for machine learning models
These libraries enable the entire workflow, from data analysis to model evaluation.

## 3. Loading the Data
The dataset used for this project was loaded directly from an external source and consists of a large set of credit card transactions. I used pandas to load the data into a DataFrame for easy manipulation and analysis.

## 4. Data Exploration
Before diving into the modeling, I explored the data to understand its structure:

Missing Values Check: Checked for missing values to ensure data integrity.
Data Distribution: Visualized the distribution of features, including the highly imbalanced target variable (fraud vs. non-fraud).
Feature Summary: Generated summary statistics to understand the range and variability of features.
## 5. Data Preprocessing
I applied the following preprocessing steps to prepare the data for modeling:

### Feature Scaling: Used StandardScaler to standardize the feature set.
### Train/Test/Validation Split: Split the data into training, validation, and test sets using train_test_split for robust model evaluation.
## 6. Model Building
Several classification models were trained and evaluated:

Random Forest Classifier
Logistic Regression
XGBoost
Each model was wrapped in a Pipeline, which included scaling of data and model training.

## 7. Hyperparameter Tuning (Optional)
For model optimization, I used GridSearchCV to search for the best hyperparameters across the following models:

Random Forest: Tuned parameters like n_estimators, max_depth, and min_samples_split.
XGBoost: Performed hyperparameter tuning to improve the accuracy of predictions.
This exhaustive search helped identify the most effective parameters for model performance.

## 8. Model Evaluation
The models were evaluated using the validation set, with accuracy being the primary metric. Other evaluation techniques included:

### Classification Report: Displayed precision, recall, and F1-score for each model.
## 9. Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrated various approaches to credit card fraud detection using machine learning. Different models were trained, and hyperparameters were tuned to improve accuracy. The use of an imbalanced dataset (fraud vs. non-fraud) posed a challenge, but feature scaling, train/test splitting, and model tuning helped improve predictions.
