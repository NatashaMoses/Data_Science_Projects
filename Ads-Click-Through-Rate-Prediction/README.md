# Ads Click-Through Rate Prediction:

## Overview
This project involves predicting whether a user will click on an advertisement based on their browsing data. It leverages machine learning models for binary classification. The steps include data preprocessing, training, model tuning, and evaluation.

## 1. Setup and Imports
The notebook uses the following libraries:

Pandas for data manipulation.
Numpy for numerical operations.
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
Scikit-learn for machine learning models and metrics.
XGBoost for advanced modeling.

## 2. Data Loading and Exploration
The dataset, which includes features such as Daily Time Spent on Site, Age, Area Income, and Clicked on Ad, was loaded into a Pandas DataFrame. Important exploration steps include:

Data Types: Checking the data types for each feature.
Outlier Detection: A boxplot was used to identify outliers, followed by Z-score-based filtering to remove extreme values.

## 3. Data Preprocessing
Feature Scaling: Used StandardScaler to normalize numerical features.
Train/Validation/Test Split: Split the dataset into 60% training, 20% validation, and 20% test sets.

## 4. Model Building
The following models were explored:

Random Forest Classifier
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
XGBoost Classifier
Voting Classifier: An ensemble model combining the above classifiers.
A pipeline was implemented to ensure preprocessing (scaling) and model training were conducted smoothly.

## 5. Hyperparameter Tuning
GridSearchCV was used for hyperparameter tuning, particularly for optimizing the Random Forest and XGBoost models, to enhance prediction accuracy.

## 6. Model Evaluation
The models were evaluated using the validation dataset based on:

Accuracy
Precision, Recall, F1-Score: Generated using the classification_report method.

## 7. Conclusion
The project demonstrates the use of machine learning models to predict advertisement clicks. Preprocessing steps, including handling outliers and feature scaling, were crucial in ensuring model performance.
