# Predicting Air Quality Index Using Python
## Introduction
Welcome to this comprehensive machine learning project aimed at predicting Air Quality Index (AQI). In this notebook, you will find the process of data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation. Two different models—Random Forest and Linear Regression—are explored to find the best model for predicting AQI.

## This README will walk you through the following stages:

### Data Preprocessing
### Model Training
### Hyperparameter Tuning
### Model Evaluation
### Best Model Selection
## 1. Setup and Imports
The project begins by importing essential Python libraries, including pandas, scikit-learn, and numpy. These libraries are fundamental for data manipulation, scaling, model building, and evaluation.

## 2. Loading the Data
The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame. This step allows for easy handling, manipulation, and analysis of the data. Initial inspections of the dataset (like checking for missing values and data types) are performed to ensure the data is ready for preprocessing.

## 3. Data Preprocessing
During data preprocessing:

Missing values are handled, and necessary data cleaning steps are taken.
Categorical variables are encoded to make them usable by machine learning models.
The data is split into training and validation sets to ensure that the model’s performance can be evaluated on unseen data. This prevents overfitting to the training data.
## 4. Standardizing the Data
To ensure the model performs well, the features are standardized using StandardScaler. Standardization scales the data to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one, making sure that all features contribute equally to the learning process. This is especially important when using models like Linear Regression.

## 5. Training the Random Forest Model
A RandomForestRegressor is trained within a pipeline that includes data scaling. This ensures that the data is properly preprocessed before being fed into the model. The Random Forest model is a powerful algorithm that works well with structured data and is robust to overfitting, especially in high-dimensional datasets.

## 6. Hyperparameter Tuning (Random Forest)
Hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV to find the best combination of parameters for the Random Forest model. The key hyperparameters tuned include:

max_depth: The maximum depth of the tree.
min_samples_split: The minimum number of samples required to split a node.
n_estimators: The number of trees in the forest.
GridSearchCV is used with cross-validation to find the optimal parameters that minimize the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on the training data.

## 7. Training the Linear Regression Model
A LinearRegression model is trained similarly within a pipeline that includes scaling. Linear Regression provides a baseline model for predicting AQI. Key hyperparameters such as fit_intercept and copy_X are tuned using GridSearchCV to find the best-performing model.

## 8. Evaluating the Models
Both models are evaluated using the validation set. The evaluation metric used is Mean Absolute Error (MAE), which measures the average magnitude of errors in the predictions. A lower MAE indicates better performance.

The Random Forest model is evaluated first to measure its accuracy on predicting AQI.
The Linear Regression model is also evaluated to compare its performance with the Random Forest.
## 9. Best Model Selection
After evaluating both models, the one with the lowest MAE is selected as the best model for AQI prediction. This ensures that the chosen model has the best performance in terms of accuracy and generalization to unseen data.

# Conclusion
This notebook demonstrates a complete end-to-end machine learning workflow for predicting Air Quality Index. It covers data preprocessing, training and evaluating Random Forest and Linear Regression models, hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV, and selecting the best model based on the evaluation metric. This project can be adapted for similar regression problems with structured data.

By following the steps in this notebook, you can replicate the process and adjust it for your specific dataset and requirements. ​​
